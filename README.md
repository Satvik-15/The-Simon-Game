# The-Simon-Game

### View this project HERE: https://satvik-15.github.io/The-Simon-Game/

### This is how the game works:
After clicking any key to start, you will tap on tiles and try to memorize the patterns that are shown in each level, and with each level adding an extra pattern to be memorized. for example:

Level1: Yellow     >>User clicks [Yellow]

Level2: Green      >>User clicks [Yellow,Green]

Level3: Green      >>User clicks [Yellow,Green,Green]

and any mistake on remembering the correct pattern will end the game.
